# Final Projects

- See finalProjectIdeas.txt for some ideas about final project topics.
- You are NOT limited to just these ideas! Be creative.
- Find 1-2 other people with similar interests.
- First come, first served on project ideas. I'd like each group to work on a different topic.
- The purpose of the projects is both to gain programming experience, but also to learn something about the data you're analyzing or the scenario you're simulating. What do your analyses show? If you change the conditions of your simulation, what happens?
- All team members should contribute equally to the project design and the coding.
- All code should be very clearly structured and commented.
- You should also provide clear guidelines (as a help function or as a set of comments at the top of your code) to someone else about how to run your code. They shouldn't need to talk to you to get it to work.
- I am not providing strict guidelines about how many lines of code you need to write, but these projects should be the result of consistent, sustained effort over several weeks by multiple people. This will almost surely result in hundreds of lines of code, including novel classes and functions.

- As soon as you're ready, let me know who is in your team and what you plan to work on.
- In about a paragraph, describe your plans for your project, including both the writing of the code and how you plan to use it to learn something.
- Email me these plans and I will confirm with you.
